# Contributing to LeetCode Hard Pattern Templates

Thank you for considering contributing to the LeetCode Hard Pattern Templates repository! This guide will help you get started with contributing to this project.

## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Pattern Template

1. **Follow the Template Format**: All pattern templates should follow the standardized format shown in the existing examples:
   - Pattern Name
   - Category
   - Difficulty Level (LeetCode Hard focus)
   - When to Use
   - Core Idea / Intuition
   - Step-by-Step Approach
   - Python-style Pseudocode Template
   - Example LeetCode Hard Problems
   - Optimization Tips
   - Common Pitfalls

2. **File Location**: Place your new pattern in the appropriate category folder:
   - `/patterns/core/` - For core algorithm patterns
   - `/patterns/data_structures/` - For advanced data structure patterns
   - `/patterns/math_bit/` - For mathematical and bit manipulation patterns
   - `/patterns/graph/` - For graph algorithm patterns
   - `/patterns/string/` - For string algorithm patterns
   - `/patterns/special/` - For special techniques that don't fit elsewhere

3. **File Naming**: Use snake_case for file names (e.g., `sliding_window.md`, `union_find.md`).

4. **Update README.md**: Add your new pattern to the appropriate section in the README.md file.

### Improving Existing Patterns

1. **Enhancing Content**: Feel free to improve any of the following aspects of existing patterns:
   - Better explanations of core concepts
   - More detailed step-by-step approaches
   - Improved pseudocode implementations
   - Additional optimization tips or common pitfalls
   - Updated example problems (especially newer LeetCode problems)

2. **Fixing Errors**: Please fix any technical inaccuracies, typos, or formatting issues you find.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes following the guidelines above.
3. Ensure your code follows the project's style and formatting conventions.
4. Update documentation as necessary.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes and any additional information.

## Style Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language that is accessible to users with different levels of experience.
- For code examples and pseudocode, prioritize readability over brevity.
- Include comments in pseudocode to explain key steps.
- Make sure example LeetCode problems are actually hard problems that match the pattern.
- Keep optimization tips and common pitfalls practical and focused on real interview scenarios.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive in your contributions and communications.
- Provide constructive feedback when reviewing other contributions.
- Focus on improving the quality and usefulness of the content for all users.

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please open an issue in the repository for discussion.
