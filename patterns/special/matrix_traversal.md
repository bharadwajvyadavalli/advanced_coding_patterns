# Matrix Traversal / Flood Fill

## Category
Special Technique

## Difficulty Level
âœ… **LeetCode Hard**

## When to Use
- Processing 2D grids or matrices element by element
- Finding connected components in a grid
- Exploring paths through mazes or grid-based problems
- Implementing region filling or coloring algorithms
- Hard-level applications typically involve:
  - Multiple types of movements or complex movement rules
  - Grid transformation with changing states
  - Multi-stage traversals with interdependent paths
  - Optimization across multiple traversal patterns
  - Combining with other algorithms (DP, Union-Find, etc.)

## Core Idea / Intuition
Matrix Traversal techniques systematically visit cells in a 2D grid, often using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore connected regions. Flood Fill is a specialized application that finds and transforms contiguous regions meeting specific criteria.

The key insight is that 2D grids can be treated as implicit graphs, where each cell is a node and adjacent cells are connected by edges. This enables applying graph algorithms to solve complex spatial relationship problems efficiently.

For hard problems, matrix traversal often requires combining multiple techniques, handling complex state transitions, or optimizing for large grids with specific constraints.

## Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Define traversal rules**: Establish which movements are allowed (4-directional, 8-directional, etc.)
2. **Choose traversal method**: Select DFS, BFS, or other specialized approaches
3. **Track visited cells**: Implement a mechanism to avoid revisiting cells
4. **Handle boundaries**: Ensure traversal stays within the grid
5. **Implement state changes**: Apply transformations to cells as needed
6. **Process connected components**: Handle region-based operations
7. **Optimize approach**: Reduce space usage or traversal complexity if possible

## Example LeetCode Hard Problems
- LC 37: Sudoku Solver
- LC 51: N-Queens
- LC 329: Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
- LC 980: Unique Paths III
- LC 1293: Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination

## Optimization Tips
- **Traversal selection**:
  - Use DFS for exploring all possible paths or backtracking
  - Apply BFS for shortest path problems
  - Implement bidirectional BFS for faster path finding
  - Use A* search when heuristics are available
- **Space optimizations**:
  - Modify the original grid to mark visited cells when possible
  - Use bit manipulation for visited state in small grids
  - Apply run-length encoding for sparse grids
- **Algorithmic optimizations**:
  - Implement pruning to avoid unpromising paths
  - Use dynamic programming to avoid redundant traversals
  - Apply jump point search for uniform-cost grids
  - Use Union-Find for connected components in static grids
- **Problem-specific optimizations**:
  - Precompute reachable areas for multi-query problems
  - Apply coordinate compression for large sparse grids
  - Use monotonic queues for specific constraints

## Common Pitfalls
- **Off-by-one errors** in boundary checking
- **Incorrect visited cell tracking** leading to infinite loops
- **Stack overflow** with recursive DFS on large grids
- **Memory limit exceeded** with BFS on large grids
- **Inefficient queue implementations** slowing down BFS
- **Incorrect direction handling** for specific movement rules
- **Not considering diagonal movements** when they're allowed
