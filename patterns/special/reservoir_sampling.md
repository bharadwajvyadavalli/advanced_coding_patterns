# Reservoir Sampling

## Category
Special Technique

## Difficulty Level
âœ… **LeetCode Hard**

## When to Use
- Selecting a random sample from a data stream of unknown size
- When memory constraints prevent storing the entire dataset
- Choosing k elements from n items with equal probability (1/n) for each item
- Processing large datasets with limited memory
- Hard-level applications typically involve:
  - Weighted reservoir sampling
  - Distributed reservoir sampling
  - Sampling with additional constraints
  - Combining with other algorithms for complex problems
  - Optimizing for specific probability distributions

## Core Idea / Intuition
Reservoir Sampling is an algorithm for randomly selecting k samples from a stream of data with unknown or infinite size, ensuring each element has an equal probability of being selected. The algorithm maintains a "reservoir" of k elements and, as new elements arrive, probabilistically decides whether to replace existing elements based on carefully calculated probabilities.

The key insight is that by decreasing the probability of replacement as more elements are processed, the algorithm can maintain uniform sampling without knowing the total number of elements in advance.

For hard problems, reservoir sampling often needs to be extended to handle weights, distributed data, or combined with other algorithms to meet complex requirements.

## Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Initialize reservoir**: Fill the first k elements into the reservoir
2. **Process stream**: For each subsequent element, decide whether to include it
3. **Calculate probabilities**: Determine replacement probability for each new element
4. **Apply replacements**: Replace reservoir elements according to calculated probabilities
5. **Maintain invariants**: Ensure the sampling properties are preserved
6. **Handle special cases**: Account for edge cases and constraints
7. **Return sample**: Provide the final reservoir as the result

    # Process remaining elements
    i = k
    while stream.has_next():
        item = stream.next()
        i += 1
        
        # Randomly decide whether to include current element
        j = random.randint(0, i - 1)
